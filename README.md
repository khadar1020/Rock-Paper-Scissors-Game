Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This is a simple implementation of the popular game Rock-Paper-Scissors. It allows you to play the game against the computer and includes some additional features such as an autoplay button and a stopplay button. The project also updates the score every time a game is played.

How to Play

Open the rock-paper-scissors.html file in your web browser.
The game will start with an initial score of 0 for both the player and the computer.
Click on one of the buttons representing rock, paper, or scissors to make your move.
The computer will randomly choose its move, and the result of the game will be displayed on the screen.
The score will be updated based on the outcome of each game.
To autoplay the game, click on the "Autoplay" button. The game will continue playing automatically until you click the "Stopplay" button.
